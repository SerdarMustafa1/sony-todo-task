# cra-redux-todo-test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements

- node v12.16.1

## Included in package.json

- react
- redux
- react-router
- bootstrap
- jest
- enzyme
- node-sass

## Task

Create a basic todo list using:

1. react
2. redux
3. react-router
4. bootstrap
5. SASS

By the end of the test, your application should:

1. List existing tasks
2. Check off 'done' tasks
3. Remove deleted tasks
4. Change the URL as the 'intent' of the UI shifts (e.g. /new)
5. Present a UI in Bootstrap with CSS customisations in SASS
6. Store all data with a sensible redux structure of stores and actions

### Extra Credit

1. Demonstrate basic Jest/Enzyme tests
2. Comments
3. Sensible code structure
